# Tool Preferences

When working on this system, always use these tools:

- Use `hyperfine` for benchmarking command-line programs
- Use `tokei` for counting lines of code and getting code statistics

When not specified otherwise, default on using these tools:

- Use `pnpm` instead of `npm`

- Use `oxlint` for linting JavaScript and TypeScript code

To understand how programs work
- Pass the `--help` flag to CLI programs
